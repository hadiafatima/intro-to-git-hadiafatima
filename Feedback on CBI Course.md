# My Feedback on CBI Course

## Background:
I come from a non-computing background, and initially, diving into bioinformatics was challenging for me. With limited knowledge of Python and the intricacies of handling bioinformatics data, the course seemed daunting at first.

## Progress and Challenges:
However, through the class exercises, I've gained a basic understanding of the course. While Python was initially unfamiliar, I can now accomplish simple tasks. The course content, in my opinion, has been helpful in easing my entry into this field.

## What I Liked:
1. **Content Quality:**
   - The course content is well-structured complex in bigging a little bit but now aiding in my learning process.

2. **Hands-On Exercises:**
   - The class exercises have been instrumental in building my practical skills and understanding.

## Areas for Improvement:
1. **Linking to Python Libraries:**
   - I would like to see more content on integrating bioinformatics with Python libraries. Understanding how to leverage Python tools would enhance my proficiency.

2. **Manipulating Large Patient Data Files:**
   - As a beginner, dealing with large patient data files is a crucial aspect. More guidance on manipulating and extracting insights from such datasets would be immensely beneficial.

## Preferred Learning Approach:
1. **Class Drills:**
   - The combination of class drills and lectures, especially within the lecture time, has proven useful for me. This format helps in applying theoretical knowledge in a real-time context.

2. **Organizing Information:**
   - I appreciate when information is organized clearly. It helps in better comprehension and retention.

## Future Expectations:
In my learning journey, I look forward to more insights into Python integration, effective manipulation of extensive patient data, and the continuation of practical class exercises.
